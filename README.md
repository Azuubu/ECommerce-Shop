# ECommerce-Shop

The whole app works similarly to any other brand store web app.
The purpose of it is to serve as a frontend portion of a full sized project, showcasing basic functionalities and responsive design of the app.
The app is ready to be integrated into a fully working backend code as it is already functioning with an external API.

The searchbar in the top part of the app is working, just input any letter or the name of a product. Should the searchbar stop working, simply refresh the app.
The app also has a delivery form at the end of the transaction process.

It was my first "more" complex project. Although it is done only in vanilla Javascript and SCSS, the core fundamentals of the app should be on par with the requirements.
I'm currently working towards transitioning it into Typescript and ReactJS, or just simply creating a brand-new project with the technology.

The app may sometimes not load properly due to poor hosting, so I advise reloading the app if something appears to be broken.
